A Chat application with a twist! Compete with your friends against the robots questions.

How it works
---
Log into Facebook to access the chat application.  You will then be taken to the chatroom where you can:

a. casually speak with other people in the room.
b. prompt the quiz_bot to post a question to the chat room, in which everyone has the chance to type in the correct answer. Whomever gets the question correct first, gets a point.  A Leaderboard showing the top scorers will update as users get points.

Chat Commands
---
@info = gives information about the different type of chat commands
@quiz = posts a quiz question to the chat room. Respond by giving the lowercase question
@robot = ...try it out for yourself :)
@wdi3 = represent!
@reset_question = resets the quiz question, type @quiz to prompt another quiz question.
